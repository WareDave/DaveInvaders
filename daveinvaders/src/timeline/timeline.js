            <p>StarCraft, released for Windows on March 31, 1998, is the first video game in the StarCraft series. A science fiction real-time strategy game,
            StarCraft is set in a distant sector of the Milky Way galaxy. A Mac OS version of the game was released by Blizzard Entertainment in March 1999.</p>
            <p>My need to win led me to using cheats in live games. The use of such had me banned from the blizzards servers. Once I realized it was my key that was banned and not my IP.
            The journey began to find a new way in.
            The solution being to applying a brute force attack to generate new keys. Enters Python and Cryptanalysis.
            This power was too strong. The young wizard knew this knowledge must be keep secret, for the safety of the realm could be at risk.</p>

              Sass (short for syntactically awesome style sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading
               Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself.
              Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the indented syntax," uses a syntax similar to Haml.It uses indentation to
               separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules.
              The newer syntax, "SCSS" (Sassy CSS), uses block formattinglike that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to
              separate rules within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively.
