            StarCraft is set in a distant sector of the Milky Way galaxy. A Mac OS version of the game was released by Blizzard Entertainment in March 1999.</p>
            <p>My need to win led me to using cheats in live games. The use of such had me banned from the blizzards servers. Once I realized it was my key that was banned and not my IP.
            The journey began to find a new way in.
            The solution being to applying a brute force attack to generate new keys. Enters Python and Cryptanalysis.
            This power was too strong. The young wizard knew this knowledge must be keep secret, for the safety of the realm could be at risk.</p>
